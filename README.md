# 📌 Tuple Operations in Python  

## 🔍 Overview  
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores **tuples** in Python. A **tuple** is an **ordered, immutable collection** that allows **duplicate values**. Tuples are useful when storing fixed data that should not change during execution.  

### 🛠 Why Use Tuples?  
- **Immutable**: Once created, tuple elements cannot be modified.  
- **Faster than Lists**: Tuples have better performance because of their immutability.  
- **Memory Efficient**: Tuples consume less memory compared to lists.  
- **Allow Duplicates**: Unlike sets, tuples permit duplicate values.
